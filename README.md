# CustomDarkModeApp

A small React Native app that demonstrates how to:

- Add Dark Mode compatibility to your app
- Allow your users to override their phone's dark mode solely within your app

Using

- Redux
- React Navigation library

The app does not save the user's theme choices, but you could set that up with [React Native Async Storage](https://github.com/react-native-async-storage/async-storage).
